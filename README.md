Family client for calling ChatGPT API. 

## Motivation 💅

I believe that chatGPT will improve lives of my Family; But i dont believe that 20 bucks per person is a fair price
especially for new users who are still learning to find uses for ChatGPT in their lives. Therefore i'm creating a 
family client using ChatGPT Enterprise which has a pay-to-go pricing instead of 20$ per person months. The ultimate goal
is to introduce ChatGPT + encourage my family and gf to use ChatGPT in their daily lives. 

I believe this is a noble cause ⛪️

## Ideas of Future Features

🚨 Usage view (in terms of OpenAI/Homepod Credit)

💡 Option to use open source models (OpenAssistant, Llama 70B, Llama 13B, Grok?) that runs on the cloud (HomePod)

💡 Option to use local inference (though im bit skeptical about the inference speed, but then I'm using rust 🦀)
